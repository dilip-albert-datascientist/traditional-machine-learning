    "Mann-Whitney U test is a nonparametric statistical significance test for determining whether two independent samples were drawn from a population with the same distribution. The default assumption or null hypothesis is that there is no difference between the distributions of the data samples. Rejection of this hypothesis suggests that there is likely some difference between the samples. More specifically, the test determines whether it is equally likely that any randomly selected observation from one sample will be greater or less than a sample in the other distribution. If violated, it suggests differing distributions. \n",
    "Therefore, if our assumption is correct, the result of the test should enable us to reject the null hypothesis."
