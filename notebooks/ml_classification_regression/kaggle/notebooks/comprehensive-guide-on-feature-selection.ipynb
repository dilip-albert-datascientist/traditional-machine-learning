The selection of features is independent of any machine learning algorithms. Instead, features are selected on the basis of their scores in various statistical tests for their correlation with the outcome variable. The characteristics of these methods are as follows:-\n\n  - These methods rely on the characteristics of the data (feature characteristics)\n  - They do not use machine learning algorithms.\n  - These are model agnostic.\n  - They tend to be less computationally expensive.\n  - They usually give lower prediction performance than wrapper methods.\n  - They are very well suited for a quick screen and removal of irrelevant features.\n  \n  \n - Filter methods consists of various techniques as given below:-\n\n   -  2.1.

They are so successful because they provide in general a good predictive performance, low overfitting and easy interpretability. This interpretability is given by the fact that it is straightforward to derive the importance of each variable on the tree decision. In other words, it is easy to compute how much each variable is contributing to the decision.\n\n- Random forests consist of 4-12 hundred decision trees, each of them built over a random extraction of the observations from the dataset and a random extraction of the features. Not every tree sees all the features or all the observations, and this guarantees that the trees are de-correlated and therefore less prone to over-fitting. Each tree is also a sequence of yes-no questions based on a single or combination of features. At each node (this is at each question), the three divides the dataset into 2 buckets, each of them hosting observations that are more similar among themselves and different from the ones in the other bucket. Therefore, the importance of each feature is derived by how \"pure\" each of the buckets is.\n\n- For classification, the measure of impurity is either the Gini impurity or the information gain/entropy. For regression the measure of impurity is variance. Therefore, when training a tree, it is possible to compute how much each feature decreases the impurity. The more a feature decreases the impurity, the more important the feature is. In random forests, the impurity decrease from each feature can be averaged across trees to determine the final importance of the variable.\n\n- To give a better intuition, features that are selected at the top of the trees are in general more important than features that are selected at the end nodes of the trees, as generally the top splits lead to bigger information gains.\n\n- Please see my kernel, [Random Forest Classifier + Feature Importance - Section 13.

For example, we can transform a categorical variable to ordinal, even if it is not, and see if any interesting results come out.\n\n- We can also make a numerical variable discrete (e.g. bins); try categorical-based measures.\n\n- Some statistical measures assume properties of the variables, such as Pearson’s that assumes a Gaussian probability distribution to the observations and a linear relationship. You can transform the data to meet the expectations of the test and try the test regardless of the expectations and compare results.\n\n\n## **What Is the Best Method?**\n\n- There is no best feature selection method. Just like there is no best set of input variables or best machine learning algorithm. \n\n- Instead, we must discover what works best for your specific problem using careful systematic experimentation.\n\n- We should try a range of different models fit on different subsets of features chosen via different statistical measures and discover what works best for your specific problem.\n\n\n## **4 best ways of Feature Selection**\n\n- The 4 practical ways of feature selection which yield best results are as follows:-\n\n    1. SelectKBest\n    2. Recursive Feature Elimination\n    3. Correlation-matrix with heatmap\n    4.
