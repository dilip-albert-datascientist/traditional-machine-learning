    "Below I've put together some tips for you, as well as some general best-practice ideas you won’t necessarily find through Google:\n",
    "\n",
    "Research the company, its products/services and your interviewers.\n",
    "You will likely be asked some questions about what you've found out about them and the company. So I'd recommend researching their product offering as well as target customers. Likely within this piece, they will be interested to know why you're interested in this role and them as an employer.\n",
    "I'd be specific when answering this - so many times people get asked this kind of question and give a generic 'because it's a great brand' type response. In many instances, this shows someone hasn't really thought about it properly.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Why them?\n",
    "- Why this role?\n",
    "- What value does it bring to you in your career development and what can you bring to them too?\n",
    "\n",
    "In reality, this simple question is a two-way street. You should get something from the job, and you should be able to show what you bring to the role which you know they will see as valuable and useful too.\n",
    "\n",
    "Competency Questions:\n",
    "Google is a great resource for helping you with this – so if you’ve not experienced these types of questions before. Have a quick look to see the types of questions that might arise and what they’re typically probing for. Also, look up the STAR method for guidance on how to structure answers, and avoid waffling or going off-topic.\n",
    "One tip you won’t typically find, but is important, is to not over-use the same example to answer multiple competencies. If you rely too heavily on one example to cover multiple scenarios, it gives an impression of experience being quite thin. So ensure you show variety.\n",
    "\n",
    "That said, if you have to reuse one, I'd caveat a response by saying it's the best one to demonstrate the competence they're looking for. But then explain you have a second, it's just not as good.\n",
    "Negative questions like - \"example a time when you've failed to achieve something\". They're looking for one or two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "- You failed because you were pushing the envelope, going outside your comfort zone and trying something different. This shows character, and a willingness to get involved. Not always playing it too safe.\n",
    "- You tried, you failed, you learnt something from it. In your response, you should show how you took that learning and applied it going forward and made it a success next time. This shows growth.\n",
    "\n",
    "You'll see with both of these you're demonstrating positive traits to a negative question. You can also use and demonstrate both aspects in one response.\n",
    "When you get a negative question thrown at you think 'what are they really looking for with this?' and position your answers to show this, putting a positive spin into it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wrapping up\n",
    "Towards the end, you're likely to be asked something like 'do you have any questions for me?'. Responding with 'no, I think you've covered everything' is typically not a good response.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd recommend something which may be out of the typical, as some of these:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can you tell me some of the things the firm put in place to support its employees during these challenging periods with Covid.\n",
    "(great to give you an idea of how good an employer's been with its people)\n",
    "- What do you see as the most pressing challenges in the coming quarter and year? How would I, if successful, be playing a part in helping you or the business overcome this?\n",
    "- How would I be measured for my success in the role? Are there any KPI's you're able to share?\n",
    "- What do you love most about the company and your role? How have they helped you develop and grow over your time here?\n",
    "\n",
    "A strong close\n",
    "Don’t leave your interviewers with unanswered questions or doubts. So be sure to ask them ‘Is there anything I’ve said, or maybe not covered in enough detail for you, which will leave you with any doubt in my ability to do this role successfully?’\n",
    "Better to get their alarm bells out whilst you’re there, able to answer them than leave them with any doubts post-interview.\n",
    "\n",
    "I hope this helps - if there's any other guidance I can provide, please let me know."
